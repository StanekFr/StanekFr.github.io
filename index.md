I am a <b>postdoc at the [Dept. of Geophysics, Colorado School of Mines](https://geophysics.mines.edu/)</b>.

<p align="justify">I am a member of <b><a href="https://rcp.mines.edu/">Reservoir Characterization Project (RCP)</a></b> and <b><a href="https://cwp.mines.edu/">Center for Wave Phenomena (CWP)</a></b> research groups. RCP and CWP are consortia funded by industry and directly collaborating with industry, government agencies and other academic institutions.</p>

<p align="justify">I focus on the processing of <b>microseismic data</b> acquired using <b>DAS or traditional geophones/seismometers</b> either at the surface or in the borehole. In particular, I am trying to better understand the relationship between reservoir and seismicity induced during subsurface operations such as <b>hydraulic fracturing, CO2 injection, wastewater injection, and mining</b>. I am also interested in the topics of <b>cloud computing (AWS)</b>.
I work mainly from my office but I like going to the field as well.
