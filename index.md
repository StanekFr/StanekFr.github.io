I am a **postdoc at the [Dept. of Geophysics, Colorado School of Mines](https://geophysics.mines.edu/)**.

I am a member of **[Reservoir Characterization Project (RCP)](https://rcp.mines.edu/)** and **[Center for Wave Phenomena (CWP)](https://cwp.mines.edu/)** research groups. RCP and CWP are consortia funded by industry and directly collaborating with industry, government agencies and other academic institutions.

I focus on the processing of **microseismic data** acquired using **DAS or traditional geophones/seismometers** either at the surface or in the borehole. In particular, I am trying to better understand the relationship between reservoir and seismicity induced during subsurface operations such as **hydraulic fracturing, CO2 injection, wastewater injection, and mining**. I am also interested in the topics of **cloud computing (AWS)**.
I work mainly from my office but I like going to the field as well.

On this website, you'll find info about me and the projects I contribute to.
