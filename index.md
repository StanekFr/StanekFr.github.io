I am currently a postdoc at the
[Colorado School of Mines](https://geophysics.mines.edu/). I am a member of Reservoir Characterization Project ([RCP](https://rcp.mines.edu/)) and Center for Wave Phenomena ([CWP](https://cwp.mines.edu/)) research groups. RCP and CWP are consortia funded by industry and directly collaborating with industry, government agencies and other academic institutions.

I focus on processing **microseismic** data acquired by **DAS or traditional geophones/seismometers** either at the surafce or in borehole. In particular 
I am trying to better understand relationship between reservoir and seismicity induced during subsurface operations such as **hydraulic fracturing, CO2 injection, wastewater injection, and mining**.
I am also interested in the topics of **cloud computing**.
I work mainly from my office but like going to the field as well.

On this website you'll find infos and links to the projects I contribute to.
