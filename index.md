I am a postdoctoral fellow at the 
[Colorado School of Mines](https://geophysics.mines.edu/),

I&#160;specialize in data processing of **DAS microseismic**, in particular 
induced during **hydraulic fracturing**. 
I do this mostly...

I am also active around the topics of **cloud computing**.
On this website you'll find infos and links to the projects I contribute to.
